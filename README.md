Integrating reinforcement learning within a cognitive framework for pattern detection

We develop a Bayesian model that incorporates reinforcement learning to tackle the issue of detecting interesting and novel patterns within a cognitive based framework. Humans are able to detect novel patterns with ease, unfortunately it is difficult to endow computers with the same capabilities. Therefore, in this work we employ reinforcement learning to optimize the best choice of pattern detection methods for various data tasks. We simulate a number of cognitive based criteria within a Bayesian framework to capture subjective measures of surprisingness, novelty and usefulness. These subjective measures are grouped into hard and soft beliefs, whereby patterns are judged as interesting or not. Soft beliefs can be revised by new patterns but hard beliefs cannot and probably represent noise or errors in the patterns.   By trial and error, the reinforcement learner will eventually select the most appropriate measures to use for a given data set to identify interesting patterns. We demonstrate our methods on a number of data sets and highlight our novel approach for seeking interesting patterns.
